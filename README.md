# KeyboardVisualizer

**This is my new Keyboard visualizer, as the name says, it visualizes which keyboard keys you type, it also has a built in rgb feature, and fancy animations.**



## Contributions are welcomed

i'm a solo developer and still learning, i'd appreciate if you can help with my project.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### To-do list

- Add a "no animations" toggle button
-  Add a Toggle button to switch from dark mode to light mode and viceversa
- make the visuals more appealing, it looks ugly now.
- 60 FPS animations.
